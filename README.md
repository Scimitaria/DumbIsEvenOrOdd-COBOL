# DumbIsEvenOrOdd-COBOL
Autogenerates a brute-force IsEvenOrOdd solution in COBOL.

dumb.cbl contains an example for the number 1000, which is the default if no argument is provided.

dumb is a shell script that generates dumb.cbl directly, while run executes generator.cbl to generate COBOL with COBOL

I'm only doing this because a friend dared me to.
